* some useful function name trick.
** functions ("__xxx")
   Some of the internal functions ("__xxx") are useful when manipulating whole lists
   rather than single entries, as sometimes we already know the next/prev entries and
   we can generate better code by using them directly rather than using the generic
   single-entry routines. (entries means a specific node, such as head node or tail node)
